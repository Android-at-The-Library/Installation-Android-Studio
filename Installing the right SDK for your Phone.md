# Installing the right SDK for your Phone.md

## finding out which version of Android you have

You will need to check which version of Android you have, e.g., Jelly Bean (18 aka 4.2), KitKat (19 aka 4.3), or Lollipop (20 aka 5+)


1) open "Settings" on your phone

2) scroll down to where it says "About Device"
